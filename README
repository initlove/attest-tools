DISCLAIMER

attest-tools is currently under development; this is a preliminary version.



INTRODUCTION

Managing the complete lifecycle of remote attestation can be very
complicate. A TSS library performs only part of the operations necessary
for the creation and verification of TPM objects. Other open source
solutions, such as IBM Attestation Client Server (ACS), have fixed purpose
and for this reason, they are difficult to customize and integrate in other
solutions.

attest-tools is a set of libraries and tools that can be used for managing
the complete lifecycle of remote attestation. Its advantages are:

- library API: main functions are exposed as a library: applications
  wanting to provide Trusted Computing services can simply link this
  library;

- modular design: variable parts, such as event log parsers or verifiers,
  are modularized; attest-tools functionality can be easily extended with
  third-part modules that support new event log format or new verifiers;

- simplicity: data to be processed and the status of the processing are
  stored in contexts created by the applications; library functions
  directly operate on these contexts;

- completeness: the library provide functions for all phases of the
  remote attestation lifecycle; it supports both implicit and explicit
  remote attestation.



EXPLICIT vs IMPLICIT ATTESTATION

Explicit attestation means establishing a communication between a target
system and a verifier with the purpose of determining whether the former
satisfies requirements of the latter. It is called explicit because the
goal of the communication is explicitly to attest a system.

Implicit attestation means that attestation is not the primary purpose of
the communication, but requirements can be verified as part of the
establishment or execution of another protocol (e.g. TLS). This alternative
should be preferable to the explicit one, as it is easier to integrate in
legacy products. On the other end, implicit attestation introduces
additional challenges such as having a fixed representation of the system
state that can be translated in one or multiple Platform Configuration
Register values.

attest-tools allows verifiers to perform both explicit and implicit
attestation.



SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

attest-tools is composed of different libraries, RA client/server and TLS
client/server.

Base lib - libattest.so

The base library is the main library of attest-tool and provides basic
services for the other more complex libraries. Essentially, it is
responsible to manage the data and verifier contexts, and verify the TPM
structure TPMS_ATTEST (which might contain a quote or a certify info). The
base library exposes a north-bound interface (Application API), intended to
be used by applications, and a south-bound interface (Developer API),
intended to be used by developers willing to extend the library
functionality.


SKAE lib - libskae.so

The SKAE library is the library that manages the Subject Key Attestation
Evidence X.509 extension defined by TCG:

https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/IWG_SKAE_Extension_1-00.pdf

It offers function for the creation and for the verification of the data
inside the extension.


Enroll client lib - libenroll_client.so

The enrollment library for clients is responsible for performing the
preliminary steps necessary for remote attestation: obtaining an AK
certificate from the Privacy CA (implemented by attest_tools_server), for
obtaining a certificate for generated TPM keys (which can be used with
openssl_tpm2_engine), and for verifying a quote.


Enroll server lib - libenroll_server.so

The enrollment library for servers is responsible to verify the requests
sent by clients and to issue certificates. The function to issue
certificates can be replaced with functions from applications' developers.


Event log parsers - libeventlog_*.so

These libraries implement parsers for event logs. Currently, the following
parsers are available:

- BIOS event log (TCG v1.2 and v2.0);

- IMA event log (ima-ng and ima-sig templates, little endian).


Event log verifiers - libverifier_*.so

These libraries implement verifiers for event logs. Each verifier might
take requirement from remote attestation verifiers, that must be satisfied
by the system being attested. Currently, the following verifiers are
available:

- BIOS: no checks are done at the moment; verifiers must explicitly specify
  'always-true' as requirement to skip verification;

- IMA boot aggregate: calculates the digest of PCRs 0-7 obtained by
  simulating the PCR extend operation with digests from the provided event
  logs, and compares the result with the file digest in the first entry of
  the IMA measurement list;

- IMA cp: obtains the path of the files from the IMA measurements list that
  don't have signature, so that it can be transfered from systems being
  attested to remote attestation verifiers;

- IMA sig: verifies the signature of files by using the content of
  /etc/keys/x509_ima.der (must be provided) as certificate; verifier must
  accept the public key by providing the certificate common name as a
  requirement (in the future, it must check the validity of the
  certificate);

- IMA policy: checks that the loaded IMA policy is one of the pre-defined
  types (currently, only the 'exec-policy' type is defined); the desired
  policy type must be specified by the verifier as a requirement;

- EVM key: checks that the EVM key is securely generated by the TPM (this
  probably will change, as it seems that the TCG specification don't allow
  the sensitive data origin bit to be set for sealed data blobs); it also
  checks the PolicyPCR policy by using the event logs supplied by the
  system being attested and the PCR selection provided by the verifier as a
  requirement.


RA client - attest_ra_client

Contacts RA server for AK/TLS certificate and for verifying a quote. It use
TCP/IP for communication.


RA server - attest_ra_server

Processes requests from RA client It use  TCP/IP for communication.


TLS client - attest_tls_client

It establishes a TLS communication with the TLS server. Before establishing
TLS, it exchanges attestation data with the TLS server, so that both client
and server certificates (the SKAE extension) can be verified.


TLS server - attest_tls_server

It receives requests from the TLS client. Before establishing TLS, it
exchanges attestation data with the TLS clients, so that both client and
server certificates (the SKAE extension) can be verified.



DATA AND VERIFIER CONTEXTS

Passing data required to perform remote attestation might not be always
possible. For example, in order to perform the verification of the SKAE
extension in a certificate, an application might pass the skae_callback()
function as argument to SSL_CTX_set_verify(). OpenSSL provides the
definition of the callback function, and new parameters cannot be
introduced.

To overcome this issue, the data and verifier contexts concept has been
defined. A data context is a data structure that contains a linked list of
data pointers and length for each type of defined information (for example
a Privacy CA certificate, or the public part of an AK). The reader can have
a look to include/ctx.h for more details.

A verifier context contains the list of requirements provided by a remote
attestation verifier (these requirements are passed to the verifiers
plugins mentioned above). It also contains a log for each verification step
executed and its status. If a verification step failed, the first log
contains the reason of the failure, while previous logs (created by the
callers of the failed function) have as reason '<called function> failed'.

For the data context, the base library provides functions to add binary
data from buffers and files. It also provides functions to import/print
JSON strings. Support for other data format might be provided.

For the verifier context, the base library provides functions to set
verifier requirements, to set the mask of PCRs to check, and to print the
logs with the list and result of the executed verification steps.

An application might pass a NULL pointer as data or verifier context. In
this case a global context (defined in the library) is used. This is the
only way to use the skae_callback() for OpenSSL, as it is not possible to
add a data and verifier context as parameters.



USE CASES

This section provides an overview of how attest-tools can accomplish most
common tasks. The reader can modify these examples to implement his
scenario.


Create an AK and request a certificate:

Preliminary Steps (on the server)
1) use existing CA or generate a new custom CA (key: cakey.pem,
   key password: 1234, cert: cacert.pem)
2) configure a TPM (a software TPM is sufficient)
3) install openssl_tpm2_engine
4) create a key and certificate for the TLS server

Preliminary Steps (on the client)
1) obtain the EK credential from TPM NVRAM: ekcert_read.sh -a sha256 \
   -o ek_cert.pem
2) manually retrieve CA certificates of EK credential and add their path to
   the file 'list', one per line

Steps (on the server)
1) generate verifier requirements:

$ attest_build_json -j reqs -k 'dummy|verify' -q '' req-dummy.json

2) execute:

$ attest_ra_server -r req-dummy.json

Steps (on the client)
1) execute:

$ attest_ra_client -a -s <attest_server FQDN>


Create a TPM key not bound to any PCR, save attestation data to attest.txt
and request a certificate:

Steps (on the client)
1) execute:

$ attest_ra_client -k -s <attest_server FQDN> -r attest.txt


Perform implicit RA:

Steps (on the server)
1) execute:

$ attest_tls_server -k key.pem -c cert.pem -d ca_cert.pem \
  -r req-dummy.json -S -V

Steps (on the client)
1) execute:

$ attest_tls_client -k tpm_key.pem -c key_cert.pem -d ca_cert.pem \
  -s <attest_server FQDN> -e -a attest.txt


Create a TPM key bound to PCRs 0-9,10 and request a certificate:

Preliminary Steps (on the client)
1) ensure that the client has a BIOS event log accessible from
   /sys/kernel/security/tpm0/binary_bios_measurements
2) ensure that the client has a IMA event log accessible from
   /sys/kernel/security/ima/binary_runtime_measurements and that no IMA
   policy is loaded
3) copy the name of the file containing the Privacy CA certificate to
   a file named 'list_privacy_ca'


Steps (on the server)
1) create verifier requirement:

$ attest_build_json -j reqs -k 'bios|verify' -q 'always-true' \
  req-bios-ima.json
$ attest_build_json -j reqs -k 'ima_boot_aggregate|verify' -q '' \
  req-bios-ima.json

2) execute:

$ attest_ra_server -r req-bios-ima.json -p 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Steps (on the client)
1) run:

$ attest_ra_client -k -s <attest_server FQDN> -r attest.txt -b -i \
  -p 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10


Perform implicit RA:

Steps (on the server)
1) execute:

$ attest_tls_server -k key.pem -c cert.pem -d ca_cert.pem \
  -r req-bios-ima.json -S -V -p 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Steps (on the client)
1) execute:

$ attest_tls_client -k tpm_key.pem -c key_cert.pem -d ca_cert.pem \
  -s <attest_server FQDN> -e -a attest.txt


Perform explicit RA:

Steps (on the client)
1) run:

$ attest_ra_client -q -s <attest_server FQDN> -b -i \
  -p 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10


Update PCR and perform again explicit RA:

Steps (on the client)
1) run:

$ tsspcrextend -halg sha1 -ha 10 -ic "test"
$ attest_ra_client -q -s <attest_server FQDN> -b -i \
  -p 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

This time RA should fail.
